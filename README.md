# Intro

CNES proposes experiments based on the study of the behavior of Physarum Polycephalum or Blob in collaboration with the Alpha mission of Thomas Pesquet.

On Earth, 2 000 classes will follow Audrey Dussutour's protocols to reproduce the same experiments and transmit their results.

Here are the experiments performed by the classes of 5Ã¨me 1 & 5Ã¨me 2 of the Jean Moulin high school in Marseille
